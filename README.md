Pipeline CI/CD Example Project
This project demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Mocha and Chai for testing in a Node.js environment. The pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests whenever code is pushed to the repository.

Features
Mocha for running unit tests.
Chai for assertions in the tests.
CI/CD pipeline configuration using GitHub Actions.
The project structure includes tests located in the test/ directory.
Prerequisites
Before getting started, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Install Node.js (which includes npm).
Ensure you have access to the GitHub repository and GitHub Actions is enabled for this project.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Kopieren
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipeline-ci-cd.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Kopieren
cd pipeline-ci-cd
Install the project dependencies:

bash
Kopieren
npm install
Running Tests Locally
To run the tests locally, use the following command:

bash
Kopieren
npm test
This will execute Mocha and run all the test files located in the test/ directory. The tests will use Chai for assertions.

CI/CD Pipeline
This project is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate testing. The configuration is located in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file.

Key Steps in the CI Pipeline:
Checkout the Code: The latest code is checked out from the repository.
Setup Node.js: The Node.js environment is set up using actions/setup-node.
Install Dependencies: The project dependencies are installed using npm.
Run Tests: The tests are run using Mocha to ensure the code is correct.
Workflow Trigger
The workflow is triggered on any push to the main branch or pull requests targeting the main branch.
